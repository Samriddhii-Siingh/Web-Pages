    <p>Better known as the <i><b>“Pink City”</b></i>, Jaipur is a city exploding with culture, life and people!
    There’s much more to Rajasthan’s capital, Jaipur than its pink-red-tinged buildings and historic splendour.</p>

        <p>Watch fascinatingly carved windows of the Palace of Winds, Hawa Mahal, light up with the sun. Right on the main road, all you need to do is wake up early for a perfect start to your day with the silhouette of Hawa Mahal against the brightening sky.</p>

        <img src="city palace.jpg" alt="City Palace" width="500px" height="300px">
        <p>City Palace forms one of the most famous tourist attractions and a major landmark in Jaipur. The beautiful palace was built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh during his reign. Among the various forts and palaces of Jaipur, City Palace stands apart, with its outstanding art and architecture.</p>

    <section><a id="AlbertHall"><h3><u>Albert Hall Museum</u></h3></a>
        <img src="albert hall.jpg" alt="Albert Hall" width="500px" height="300px">
        <p>The oldest museum in Rajasthan, the Albert Hall Museum boasts an extensive collection of art and historically significant artifacts. Come for the Egyptian mummy, stay to see antique coins from different periods in India's history, 18th-century costumes worn by members of different castes, and a peculiar collection of 19th-century clay figures demonstrating all the yoga poses.</p>

        <img src="jal mahal.jpg" alt="Jal Mahal" width="500px" height="300px">
        <p>One look at the Jal Mahal, and you might think you're seeing a mirage. The graceful palace seems to float atop the twinkling Man Sagar Lake—a calm sight compared to the rest of the frenzied city.
        While it appears to have just one story, the Water Palace has four other levels submerged beneath a reservoir.</p>

    <section><a id="BirlaTemple"><h3><u>Birla Temple</u></h3></a>
        <img src="birla temple.jpg" alt="Birla Temple" width="500px" height="300px">
        <p>In a city that seems to be dipped from top to bottom in pink, the stark white marble Birla Mandir stands out—big time. The Hindu temple pays tribute to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and purity, and Vishnu, one of the religion's main deities.</p>
